# Oxide and Friends: September 23rd, 2024

## RTO or GTFO

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/Y-cC5pUXjbQ).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
speakers included
friend of the pod, Matt Amdur,
and Chris.

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Message from CEO Andy Jassy: Strengthening our culture and teams](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio)
- [OxF: The Future of Work](https://share.transistor.fm/s/7daf8df8)
- [Amazon leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles)
- [Nathanael's blog: Building Big Systems with Remote Hardware Teams](https://oxide.computer/blog/building-big-systems-with-remote-hardware-teams)

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
server; stay tuned to our Mastodon feeds for details, or [subscribe to this
