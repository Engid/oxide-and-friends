# Oxide and Friends: April 22nd, 2024

## All we have to fear is FUD itself

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/ZzI3MvZ0fHo).

Your hosts were
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Infoworld: OpenTofu may be showing us the wrong way to fork](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3714980/opentofu-may-be-showing-us-the-wrong-way-to-fork.html)
- [OpenTofu response](https://opentofu.org/blog/our-response-to-hashicorps-cease-and-desist/)
- PRs needed!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
server; stay tuned to our Mastodon feeds for details, or [subscribe to this

We'd love to have you join us, as we always love to hear from new speakers!
