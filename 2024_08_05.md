## Pragmatic LLM usage with Nicholas Carlini

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/UPTAX30ttMQ).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
we were joined by special guest, Nicholas Carlini
as well as by listeners
